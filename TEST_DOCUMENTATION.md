## Manual Testing Scenarios

In addition to automated tests, the following manual testing scenarios should be performed:

### Scenario 1: Complete Booking Flow
1. Register a new customer
2. View available vehicles
3. Create a booking for 7+ days
4. Generate invoice and verify discount
5. Verify vehicle status changed to Reserved

### Scenario 2: Cancellation Flow
1. Create a booking
2. Immediately cancel it
3. Verify vehicle status changed back to Available
4. Verify deposit refund message

### Scenario 3: Update Flow
1. Create a booking
2. Update dates and kilometers
3. Generate invoice with new values
4. Verify calculations are correct

### Scenario 4: Edge Case Testing
1. Try booking with 1-day advance (should fail)
2. Try cancelling after 2 days (should fail)
3. Try booking unavailable vehicle (should fail)
4. Try generating duplicate invoice (should warn)

## Test Data Management

### Initial State
- 8 pre-loaded vehicles (V001-V008)
- No customers
- No bookings
- No invoices

### Test Data Cleanup
Tests create temporary data with unique identifiers:
- TEST*, REMOVE*, BOOK*, CANCEL*, UPDATE*, INV*, CALC*, DISC*, EXTRAKM*, PRICE*

## Known Limitations

1. Tests run in sequence and may affect each other's state
2. No database persistence - data resets on restart
3. Date-based tests use relative dates (days from now)
4. No concurrent booking tests

## Recommendations for Extended Testing

1. **Performance Testing**: Test with large datasets (1000+ vehicles, customers, bookings)
2. **Stress Testing**: Concurrent booking attempts on same vehicle
3. **Integration Testing**: Test with actual database
4. **UI Testing**: Test all CLI menu options and input validation
5. **Security Testing**: Test input sanitization and validation

## Conclusion

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of all core functionalities and business rules. All 21 tests should pass in a clean environment, validating that the system meets all specified requirements.
