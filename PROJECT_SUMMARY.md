## Technical Architecture

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separation
2. **Enum Pattern**: Type-safe constants for categories and statuses
3. **Repository Pattern**: Data management through service classes
4. **Builder Pattern**: Complex object construction (Invoice)

### OOP Principles Applied
1. **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters/setters
2. **Abstraction**: Service layer abstracts business logic
3. **Polymorphism**: Method overriding (toString())
4. **Inheritance**: Enum classes extend Java's Enum type

### Package Structure

## Data Model

### Entity Relationships
```
Customer (1) ──────── (*) Booking (*) ──────── (1) Vehicle
                           │
                           │ (1)
                           │
                           ▼
                       Invoice (1)
```

### Key Entities
1. **Vehicle**: 4 attributes, 10 methods
2. **Customer**: 5 attributes, 12 methods
3. **Booking**: 10 attributes, 15 methods
4. **Invoice**: 10 attributes, 13 methods

## Pricing Model

### Vehicle Categories
| Category | Daily Rate | Free KM | Extra KM | Tax |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|-----|
| Compact Petrol | LKR 5,000 | 100 km/day | LKR 50/km | 10% |
| Hybrid | LKR 7,500 | 150 km/day | LKR 60/km | 12% |
| Electric | LKR 10,000 | 200 km/day | LKR 40/km | 8% |
| Luxury SUV | LKR 15,000 | 250 km/day | LKR 75/km | 15% |

### Pricing Formula
```
Base Price = Daily Rate × Number of Days
Extra KM Charges = (Total KM - Free KM) × Extra KM Rate
Discount = Base Price × 10% (if days >= 7)
Subtotal = Base Price + Extra KM Charges - Discount
Tax = Subtotal × Tax Rate
Total = Subtotal + Tax
Final Amount = Total - Deposit (LKR 5,000)
```
